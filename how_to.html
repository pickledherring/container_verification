        Welcome!
    </h3>
    <p>
        &ensp;&ensp;This is a training tool for measuring containers and racks.
        Basically, all you have to do is choose a container and/or rack from
        the handy dropdowns, enter in your measurements, press "Finish" (with
        dropdown menu next to it set to "Evaluate"), and this site will tell
        you how you did. There is a limit of three tries per container/rack/combo,
        but nothing happens if you exceed it (yet >:D).
    </p><br>
    <p>
        &ensp;&ensp;You can collapse sections if they displease you, and you can choose
        other submit options from the dropdown next to the "Finish" button.
        Those other options include adding a new rack or container option.
        Currently, Dave Barton, Mike Reyes, and I, Gabe Salmon, have write permissions for
        this page, so only we can actually do much with those choices.
        If you want to cheat and look at the true values, you can follow the
        steps below, skipping (1) and (5) onwards. There will be an extra object, don't
        worry about it. It's an internal representation, so my apologies about the
        legibility. The fields are in the same order as the site's fields, though.
    </p><br>
    <p>
        &ensp;&ensp;If you're Dave, Mike, or you hacked into our github accounts, you can add
        an object with these steps:<br>
        1. fill in the correct values. don't worry about the name.<br>
        2. select "Add Container" or "Add Rack", as appropriate, and click "Finish".<br>
        3. follow the prompts, and when you're done, scroll to the top of the page.<br>
        4. a link will become visible to download at the top.<br>
        5. copy and paste the entire contents of that file over the entire contents
        of cont_truth.js or rack_truth.js in the repository, as appropriate, and
        save the file.<br>
        6. if you're in VS Code, go to Source Control in the left ribbon (1 in the
        image below).<br>
        7. click the ellipses (2), then click "Pull".<br>
        8. click the plus button next to "Changes" (3).<br>
        9. enter a message in the prompt above that (4).<br>
        10. click the check mark above that (5), and push "Sync Changes" when it pops up.
    </p><br>
        That's all! Please give any worthwhile suggestions to us. If you want to
        become a maintainer on the repository, I can get you set up.
    <br><br>
        Best,<Br>
        Gabe
